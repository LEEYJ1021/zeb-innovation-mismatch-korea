# Diagnosing Regional R&D Imbalances in Zero-Energy Buildings: A GIS–Topic Modeling Approach for Smart Built Environment Planning in South Korea

This repository contains the code, processed data, and supplementary materials necessary to reproduce the findings of the study **“Diagnosing Regional R&D Imbalances in Zero-Energy Buildings: A GIS–Topic Modeling Approach for Smart Built Environment Planning in South Korea.”**

The study develops a novel data-driven framework to quantitatively diagnose the *spatiotemporal mismatch* between Zero-Energy Building (ZEB) technology supply and demand across 17 regions in South Korea, providing actionable intelligence for smart built environment planning.

## 📄 Abstract

The adoption of Zero-Energy Buildings (ZEB) is often constrained by critical misalignments between regional market demand and research and development (R&D) supply. This study proposes a comprehensive data-driven framework that integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and dynamic topic modeling to diagnose such spatiotemporal imbalances, focusing on smart technologies in the built environment.

A **ZEB Opportunity Index** is constructed using robust geospatial indicators across South Korean regions, applying a Mahalanobis distance–based TOPSIS methodology to quantify demand patterns. In parallel, a **Technology Supply Index** is derived from a corpus of 1,528 academic papers using BERTopic-based dynamic topic modeling. A machine learning pipeline using Gradient Boosting Regressor calculates a **Comprehensive Impact Score (CIS)** for weighting regional technology supply.

A **Mismatch Index**—computed from nationally normalized demand and supply indices—reveals critical spatial R&D gaps and oversupply zones. Results highlight substantial disparities: Seoul shows severe technological gaps despite high demand, Daejeon displays extreme R&D saturation, and provincial regions such as Gangwon and Chungcheongbuk-do remain strategic blind spots. The framework offers actionable intelligence for policymakers and urban planners to optimize innovation ecosystems and accelerate transitions toward resilient, high-performance urban environments.

## 🧭 Framework Overview

The analytical framework integrates geospatial analysis, text mining, and decision science:

### **1. ZEB Opportunity Index (Demand-Side Analysis)**

* Quantifies potential ZEB demand across 17 regions.
* **Method**: Multi-layer geospatial synthesis (development zones, renewals, environmental constraints).
* **Model**: Entropy-Weighted TOPSIS with Regularized Mahalanobis Distance.

### **2. Technology Supply Index (Supply-Side Analysis)**

* Measures regional ZEB R&D capacity based on 1,528 academic papers.
* **Method**: BERTopic dynamic topic modeling to extract technology clusters.
* **Machine Learning**: Gradient Boosting Regressor computes Comprehensive Impact Score (CIS).

### **3. Spatiotemporal Mismatch Analysis**

* Integrates normalized demand–supply indices.
* Identifies **Strategic Gap**, **R&D Saturation**, **Balanced** regions.

## 📊 Key Findings

### **✔ The “Seoul Paradox”**

Despite the highest demand, Seoul shows *major cross-cluster R&D deficits* — indicating nonspecialized or misaligned research activities.

### **✔ R&D Saturation Zones**

Daejeon exhibits *high oversupply* in clusters like “Advanced Energy Systems,” indicating an innovation bottleneck with poor spatial diffusion.

### **✔ Strategic Gap Regions**

Regions such asGangwon and Chungcheongbuk-do show *severe demand–supply deficits*, signaling priority zones for policy intervention.
